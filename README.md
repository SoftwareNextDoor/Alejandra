# Time Tracker

Time Tracker will take note of your daily activities at work.

Carlos and I (Alan), thought in the following ideas.

1. Receive an e-mail every X number of days, and by just
responding using certain format, the application
will track your activities.

2. Send a twit or post a message to fb with certain format.
